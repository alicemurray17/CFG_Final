<h2> DID YOU KNOW? </h2>

<p> Black Rhinoceros is a species of rhino found in Africa. They are heavy animals
    with a body mass of up to 1,400kg! They are now a critically endangered species. 
    This is mainly due to poaching as there is a demand for rhino horns, mainly as in some areas 
    of Asia they are used in folk medicine. Since becoming officially endangered in 2011, 
    there are less than 5,500 Black Rhinos in the world today.
