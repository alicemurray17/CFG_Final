             <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>Endangered Earth is a website engineered by three female-coders in aid of rescuing endangered species on the brink of extinction. 
              In the past decade, our eco-systems and biodiversity have delined in astronomical figures. Only 4% of the world's mammal biomass are 
              wild inhabitants. Besides from this, deforestation, poaching and other forms of human activity threaten the few which remain today.         
              Our aim with Endangered Earth is to raise awareness, spark conversation and action in demand for better protection and preservation of these
              endangered speices and all that they bring to the world. Becuase once they're gone...they truely are gone. As part of this movement, we decided
              to create a responsive, vibrant and interactive website. As three coders new to the web-development industry,  we were determined to present a site which shows our true potential and engagement 
              with this topic of choice. Here's a little about each contributer and what this project means to us! I'm Ishwari and I had the vision of this idea. 
              The urge came from my passion as an animal rights activist and enthusiast. I love the diverse wildlife that inhabits our planet, and an opportunity
              to design a website with this topic at its forefront was something I felt really passionate about! My name is Alice, I’m an undergraduate anthropology
              student and I’m living in Edinburgh at the moment. Learning to code web development  has been a huge learning curve for me as it is very different
              to anything else I am used to! However it has been really enjoyable and exciting to work on this project. Ciao! My name is Carola. I am an italian girl
              with a passion for linguistics, whether in ancient or modern languages. After studying language, literature and humanities in Sicily, I nurtured a love
              of coding and particularly web development. As an environmental activist, I could not resist when Ishwari introduced me to this project. I love the
              ability to combine coding with promoting an environmental cause. I think it is very important today to work as much as possible for the protection of
              the most endangered animal categories and remind people how crucial it is to respect and protect our planet Earth
              Education is at our aim and, to us, learning never stops. We have no doubt that you'll enjoy your journey, scrolling through our
              website, and whether we encoruage you to research further, donate to charities fighting the battle or simply change some of your 
              lifestlye habits, we strongly believe that you will stumble across something to spark your venture into the wild. Whether it be
              the depths of the Africa's Savanas or heights of the Russian Mountians. But, most importantly, we hope that wherever this adventure
               may take you, you learn something new along the way..
